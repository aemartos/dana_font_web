                        <p>This framework was born as a Graphic Design end-of-degree project. It is about the creation of a typography for web use. It consists of two parts: a modular responsive typography based on HTML language, built from SVG labels and animations; and a typography in OpenType format. I have also created a series of posters and a typographic specimen.
                        The typography consists of 4 heights with the same weight which varies depending on the device (media query) in which it is displayed.</p>

                <h2 class="title_text title_origin">Origin</h2>
                       
                <p class="subtitle_text">The project arises as a continuation to the one proposed in the subject of the first four-month period: Experimental Typography; where I studied Elena's Ramirez web work. The first prototype is based on trial and error, it is a very experimental project. While I have been building the project, I have realized the infinite possibilities of SVG and web design. Dana Font was born with a view to its application in flexible visual identities. Although that posibility it is not ruled out, I have focused the project towards its application in responsive posters. It is the first step for the creation of a system that allows interaction in web posters.</p>
                
                <p class="subtitle_text subtitle_text_project">The name of the typography has been conceived due to retro aesthetics. It is given by Dana Scully, protagonist of the series: The X-Files, by Fox. She is a female strong character that empower women, I felt the need to name the font as her, because she is inspiring in so many ways. The name fits perfectly with the personality of the typography, since it is a classic series, which refers to analog technology and that it's about the alien presence on our planet; hence, the icon set that accompanies and complements the typography. In addition, the initial typography of the series: Trixie, bases its characteristics on the variability of it, which makes it a perfect nod to the creator: Erik van Blokland, pioneer in this type of typographical experiments.</p>
            </div>


            <h3 class="title_text title_letters">Modular letters</h3>
                   
            <p class="paragraph_text">For the creation of the graphic signs, I first designed the shapes in Illustrator. From the grid I had established thanks to the research and the sketching process, I kept the concept of pixel (square) as the main modular base and started replacing the shapes that did not fit for the final modulation of the typography.</p>
            <p class="paragraph_text p05">
            As you can see, the modules are based on primary geometric shapes: a circle and a square that, through Boolean operations, have resulted in other forms, somewhat more complex, that make up the whole of the letter.
            They are not very complicated constructions, they could not be if I wanted to achieve a fluid and simple animation. In addition, the more forms there were, the more difficult it would be to replace them with others later, to create typographical variations.</p>

            <h3 class="title_text">Typographic quadrat</h3>
                   
            <p class="paragraph_text">I have determined a unique quadrat, which does not vary with the successive changes that happen. All the letters (and all their variables) are contained in a grid of 11x12. Each module have dimensions of 16px, which corresponds to the standard web measure: 1 rem.</p>
            <p class="paragraph_text p05">Since it is a web language, everything has to be written, even if it is hidden, so I decided not to modify the quadrat in each of the steps of the typography. The widths in each letter do not vary, it is a monospaced typography, ideal for composing and making transformations, since each letter occupies the same space.</p>
            <p class="paragraph_text p05">I have determined three heights, with a view to web nomenclature: ascenders, descenders and xheight. In addition, although it is a typeface that does not contain uppercase letters (the icons are them, only 10 have been considered), the relations between upper and lower boxes have been established, because certain characters will be aligned according to that proportions. The height of the descending and uppercase letters will be the same.</p>

            </div>

            <h3 class="title_text">4 heights</h3>
                   
            <p class="paragraph_text">The creating process of the letters once defined the initial parameters, has been, relatively simple, inasmuch as following the guidelines set, it has been more a mechanical work, than creative, due to the reduced modules available. With regard to the accented vowels, I have tried different accent marks, but for the development of the project I used the one shown, which is neutral and could be used for several cases.</p>
            <p class="paragraph_text p05">I have developed 3 sets of numbers: uppercase, lowercase and small caps. I have opted for the uppercase, since they are the default numbers of any font. I left the other two sets for the future expansion of the typography.</p>
            <p class="paragraph_text p05">The typography, characterized by the absence of diagonals, hindered the design of a complex set of signs, so, after several attempts, I came to the current design, which is adapted to the aesthetic that follows the rest of the typography.</p>
            <p class="paragraph_text p05">In the same way as signs, icons always have diagonals, so after some tests, I discarded the idea of ​​functional icons and began to think of merely decorative ones. From there arose the idea of ​​aliens, Martians or monsters, which I designed as a perfect complement to the font.</p>

            <h3 class="title_text">Nomenclature</h3>
                   
            <p class="paragraph_text">To get the vector graphics I designed in Illustrator converted to HTML language, I export each glyph in SVG, individually. Each individual letter is formed by labels rect (squares), path (forms that do not identify as primary) and circle (circles). The forms that have color are the path, the black ones are rect. All are numbered from left to right. The system of nomenclature is somewhat complex, but it is simplified to the maximum and is necessary.</p>

            <p class="paragraph_text p05">The lower diagram (cheatsheet), made with each letter, is what I followed to make the animations with CSS. It has helped me to visualize each transformation and to be able to know which position corresponds to each form at the moment.</p>
            <p class="paragraph_text p05">The transformations are done in rems, just like the base measure established in the typography. In the image can be seen the transformation process of the letter A.</p>

            <p class="paragraph_text">In addition to the svg responsive typography, I considered that a very useful tool would be to create the OTF version of the font and the other web versions. I have created as well, a series of typographic posters.</p>
            <p class="paragraph_text p05">Being a monospaced type, it has been relatively easy to adjust the kerning parameters. The space between characters is equal to the width of the antlers. The only case that has been treated differently has been the letter J, to improve readability and give the font more personality.</p>
            <p class="paragraph_text p05">In the same way I have created a series of posters, which test the capabilities of composing about it. They introduce the font in an editorial context. Can be seen the use of the typographic family and its behavior, so future users can visualize cases and possible applications. Communicates the style and personality of it.</p>
